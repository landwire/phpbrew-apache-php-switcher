# phpbrew-apache-php-switcher

This is a simple apache switcher script, to be used with phpbrew (NOT brew php from homebrew)!

Just put it in your "~/bin" and include this location in your $PATH or in any other location where you keep your executable scripts.
Juts type "switchapachephp" for usage and a list of installed (with phpbrew!!!) php version that you can use.

I learned a lot about the shell and the painful differences between OSX and GNU sometimes.
